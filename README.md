# Packet Labs AppConfig

This is a very simple web tool to build iPXE templates for various complex applications that can be deployed on Packet. There is a small list of applications currently supported:

## esxicfg
*Configuration Tool for ESXi*
Currently the only application. Has some work left. Allows customizing an ESXi installation based on a few questions. Currently supports changing SSH configuration, and Network options.
TODO:
 - URLs of files to download into the default datastore during install
 - Ability to choose different ESXi versions
